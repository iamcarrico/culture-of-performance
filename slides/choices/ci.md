## Continuous Integration

* Build tools (e.g. Gulp) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Frontend tests <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* CI Server Testing (Travis CI) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

Having easy-to-use build tools that any developer can use is incredibly important. Using a tool such as gulp or grunt, base frontend tests can be created that developers can use to test their code. These same build tools can be integrated into CI servers, Jenkins, Circle CI, Travis or a host of other options to test PRs and master.

Some example code on getting frontend tests built in Gulp. https://github.com/fourkitchens/frontend-perf/blob/master/gulpfile.js
