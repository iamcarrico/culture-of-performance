## Designer

* You can't have good design and be performant <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Don't take away my web fonts <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


Note: More myths that seem to pop up constantly. Mainly that designers will be unable to have good design by the constraints of performance. In reality,
performance is one of constraints of building on the web. On the flip side, it is very easy to say "no ads" or "no webfonts", or even just grumble about these things often. Even these minor gripes can start to create a schism between performance and the rest of the teamsâ€” all of these hard decisions needs to be negotiations between teams within the constraints of a performance budget.
