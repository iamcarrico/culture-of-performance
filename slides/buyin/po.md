* We don't have time to work on performance <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* We want the site to be responsive,<br> and that cannot be performant <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* A great user experience is more important <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: There are many myths about the time it takes to make a site truly performant. If started from the beginning, with appropriate budgets set, creating a performant site does not have to take substantially more time. And that time pays off very quickly. There are many studies into the page weight that is added from doing RWD. And while it is not zero, it is hardly enough to prevent a performant site. In fact, many techniques (e.g. image lazy-loading) will prevent extra resources from being downloaded.
